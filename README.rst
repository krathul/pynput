pynput
======
This is a fork of the original pynput module by Moses Palmer, with a full functional support for uinput backend.
This would allow one to use the pynput module on wayland systems.

This library allows you to control and monitor input devices.

Currently, mouse and keyboard input and monitoring are supported.

See `here <https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for the full
documentation.
